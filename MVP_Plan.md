# SpenceDew Game Design & Development Plan
## Tech Stack: C++ + raylib

---

## 1. Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Rendering / Input / Audio** | **raylib 5.5** | Single-dependency 2D rendering library, pure C API, massive community, excellent AI training coverage. Zero external IDE required — write and build entirely in VS Code. |
| **Entity / Component System** | **EnTT 3.14** (header-only) | When the entity count grows (NPCs, enemies, items), EnTT provides a fast, type-safe ECS. Not required in early MVP — plain C++ classes are fine until you feel the pain. |
| **Save / Load / Dialogue Data** | **nlohmann/json 3.11** (header-only) | Dead-simple JSON in C++. Used for save files, NPC relationship data, and loading Ink-compiled dialogue trees. |
| **Level Design** | **LDtk** (free editor) | Modern tilemap + entity placement editor. Exports to JSON; a simple C++ loader reads it. Keeps level data out of code. |
| **Dialogue & Narrative** | **Ink** (free) | Industry-standard branching dialogue scripting language. Compiles to JSON; loaded at runtime by a small C++ reader. |
| **Build System** | **CMake 4.x** | All dependencies are fetched and built automatically via `FetchContent` — just configure and build. |
| **Version Control** | **Git + GitHub** | Essential checkpoints when AI generates chunks of code that may need reverting. |

**No external IDE.** Everything — editing, building, debugging — happens in VS Code via the CMake Tools extension.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The architecture directly mirrors the Godot version but expressed in idiomatic C++:

### Finite State Machine (FSM)
`State` → `StateMachine` → `Player / Enemy`

- Each behaviour is a class that extends `State` and overrides `enter()`, `exit()`, `physicsUpdate()`.
- `StateMachine` owns all states as `unique_ptr`s, drives the active one each frame.
- Transitioning is a single call: `stateMachine->changeState("run")`.
- No macros, no reflection — just plain virtual dispatch.

### Hitbox / Hurtbox Combat
Mirrors the Godot Area2D pattern using AABB (`Rectangle`) overlap tests:

- `Hitbox` — carries damage and an active flag. Checks overlap against a list of `Hurtbox*` each frame.
- `Hurtbox` — carries an `onDamageReceived` callback (like Godot signals). The owner entity wires up its own damage logic.
- Self-damage prevented via matching `ownerEntity` void pointers.

### Event / Signal Equivalent
Godot's signals become `std::function` callbacks stored on the relevant struct (see `Hurtbox::onDamageReceived`). For global events (enemy death → XP update), a lightweight event bus or a simple global manager will be introduced in Phase 3.

### NPC Relationship Manager
A singleton class (static instance, accessed globally) holding a `std::unordered_map<std::string, NpcData>` per NPC. `NpcData` holds affection level, dialogue progress index, gifts-given flags. Serialised/deserialised with nlohmann/json.

## 4. Build Instructions

**Prerequisites (one-time):**
1. Visual Studio 2022 Community (MSVC compiler) — already installed
2. CMake 4.x — installed via winget
3. Git — already installed

**First build** (downloads all dependencies ~200 MB; only done once):
```
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

Or use **Ctrl+Shift+B** in VS Code (runs the default "Build Debug" task).

The executable lands at `build/Debug/SpenceDew.exe`.

## 5. MVP Schedule

- [x] Hitbox / Hurtbox collision system
- [x] Camera follow (2D Camera2D in raylib)
- [x] Placeholder tilemap (hardcoded rectangles as walls)

### Phase 2: Deep Combat Prototyping (Weeks 3–5)

## 6. New Challenges vs. Godot

These are things Godot handled automatically that now require explicit implementation:

| Challenge | Godot Had | raylib Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Tilemap rendering & collision** | Built-in TileMap node | Load LDtk JSON; draw source rects from tileset texture; AABB collision vs. solid layer rects |
| **Animation system** | AnimationPlayer node | `AnimatedSprite` helper: store frame rects + durations, advance timer each frame |
| **Physics / collision resolution** | CharacterBody2D + `move_and_slide()` | Manual AABB sweep; `moveAndSlide()` in Player is currently position += velocity * dt — add environment collision in Phase 2 |
| **Scene / object lifecycle** | Node tree with `queue_free()` | Manual lists of active entities; mark-and-sweep or index-based removal |
| **Signals (event bus)** | Built-in `Signal` | `std::function` callbacks on structs; or a simple templated `EventBus<T>` class for global events |
| **Dialogue plugin** | Dialogic (drag-and-drop) | Write a 100–150 line Ink JSON reader; Ink's runtime is simple enough to drive from C++ |
| **Save / load** | Built-in serialisation | nlohmann/json; define `to_json` / `from_json` for save-state structs |
| **Pathfinding** | NavMesh (built-in) | Implement grid A* for enemies; navmesh is overkill for the MVP scope |

**Architectural risk:** Because there is no enforced scene graph, AI-generated code may introduce tight coupling between systems (e.g., an enemy directly accessing a UI element). Establish and hold to the rule: **entities never touch UI; UI reads from data, not from entities.**

---

## 7. AI Prompt Strategy

- **One system at a time.** "Write an `AnimatedSprite` class for raylib that plays frame sequences by name, given a spritesheet texture and a JSON frame-data file."
- **Specify the pattern.** "Using the existing `Hitbox` / `Hurtbox` pattern in this project, write a `Projectile` class for a magic bolt that checks for enemy hurtboxes and destroys itself on hit."
- **Give context.** Paste the relevant header file(s) so the AI generates code that fits the existing API rather than inventing new abstractions.
- **Review architecture, not just logic.** As a C++ professional you're well-placed to catch when AI introduces hidden globals, raw owning pointers, or circular includes.
